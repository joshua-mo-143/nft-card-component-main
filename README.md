## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [LessCSS](https://lesscss.org/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I worked some more with LessCSS and figured out how to use mobile-first workflow to make my workflow much quicker without needing something like TailwindCSS. Also, worked a bit more with Grid CSS. I think I still prefer Flexbox at this point though :(

### Continued development

Following on from this project, I think it's fairly clear I probably need to do some more work on working with CSS grid. I enjoy using flexbox a lot because it's convenient but grid seems better for fixed layouts.
